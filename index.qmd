# Putting Probability and Statistics Together

The Wisdom of Groups and the Magic of Averages

100 people guess the jelly beans in a jar. Individually wrong, together… surprisingly close! That’s sampling.

The Central Limit Theorem: Big samples = bell curve magic.

# Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals: ‘We’re 95% sure the truth is between here and there.’ Not perfect, but close enough.

Groups calculate confidence intervals for student heights or screen time.

# P-Values & Hypothesis Testing

P-values are alarms. Small P (\<0.05) means, ‘Hey, something weird is happening!’ But is it important? Maybe it’s just noise.

# Errors in Statistics

-   Type I Error: You think there’s a ghost (false alarm).

-   Type II Error: You miss the ghost (oops, haunted).

# Confidence Intervals and Replication

Confidence intervals complement hypothesis tests by showing the range of plausible values for the result.

Replication (repeating studies) is crucial to confirm findings and avoid false discoveries.
